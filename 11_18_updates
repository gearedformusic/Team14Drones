there's an option for RigidBodies to Freeze them both for their xyz coordinates and xyz rotation. it's right in the menu, wish i'd tried it out sooner.
those Freeze checkboxes accomplish the goal of making the drones stay in place upon being moved to a new location

haven't gotten the function to apply to the drone model yet; so far just tried on a sphere.

maybe make a small sphere collider on the drone instead of the full mesh? idk the mesh seems to cause lag bc of how complex the object is...

goal for friday: apply the freezing rigidbody to the drone and get that working!
